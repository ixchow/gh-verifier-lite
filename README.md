This is an easier-to-use verifier for [http://golf.horse](http://golf.horse), built as a node script.
Note that it doesn't enforce the same sandboxing as the [real verifier](https://github.com/ixchow/gh-verifier), but it's a heck of a lot easier to get working.
```
Usage:
node verifier.js <wordlist> <program.js>
```
